I have seen lots of QA with significant years of service, still doing the same thing they did 5 years back, opening a browser, putting some strange inputs to the application and trying to break them. If you are trying to turn around and make some changes try the following

• Stop doing manual testing. Move to test automation. Use a tool like Protractor or Selenium. Have your test integrated with your team's continuous deployment process.

• Learn to test your applications service endpoints using a tool like PostMan. Create PostMan test and also add them to you CI/CD process. 

• Learn and perform penetration test. A security vulnerability is the weakest link in your software value chain and it could kill your company. Be a member of the online community like www.owasp.org. 

• Learn load testing. Use JMeter and flood.io to execute the test. Check if your software is ready for the real world.

• Learn product ownership and requirement engineering.  Be the go-to person for your development team when they have to clarify any business or technical requirement. 

• Become a process guru, uphold and improve the software development process your team is using. Learn Agile, become a coach.

Stop being a tester. Take the next step.
