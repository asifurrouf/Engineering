## Test Automation Frameworks - Stuff you must Know! 

# What is a Framework ?

Instead of providing a bookish definition of a framework, lets consider an example.

I am sure you have attended a seminar / lecture / conference where the participants was asked to observe the following guidelines -

    Participants should occupy their seat 5 minutes before start of lecture
    Bring along a notebook and pen for note taking.
    Read the abstract so you have an idea of what the presentation will be about.
    Mobile Phones should be set on silent
    Use the exit gates at opposite end to the speaker should you require to leave in middle of the lecture.
    Questions will be taken at the end of the session

Do you think you can conduct a seminar WITHOUT observing these guidelines????
The answer is a big YES! Certainly you can conduct a seminar / lecture / conference / demonstration without above guidelines (in fact some of us will not follow them even though there are laid ... :-)
But if the guidelines are followed it will result in beneficial outcome like reduced audience distraction during lecture and increased participant retention and understanding of the subject matter.
Based on above, a Framework can be defined as a set of guidelines which when followed produce beneficial results.
