## Test Automation Frameworks - [Stuff](https://www.guru99.com/quick-test-professional-qtp-tutorial-34.html) you must Know!

### What is a Framework ?

Instead of providing a bookish definition of a framework, lets consider an example.

I am sure you have attended a seminar / lecture / conference where the participants was asked to observe the following guidelines -

    Participants should occupy their seat 5 minutes before start of lecture
    Bring along a notebook and pen for note taking.
    Read the abstract so you have an idea of what the presentation will be about.
    Mobile Phones should be set on silent
    Use the exit gates at opposite end to the speaker should you require to leave in middle of the lecture.
    Questions will be taken at the end of the session

Do you think you can conduct a seminar WITHOUT observing these guidelines????
The answer is a big YES! Certainly you can conduct a seminar / lecture / conference / demonstration without above guidelines (in fact some of us will not follow them even though there are laid ... :-)
But if the guidelines are followed it will result in beneficial outcome like reduced audience distraction during lecture and increased participant retention and understanding of the subject matter.
Based on above, a Framework can be defined as a set of guidelines which when followed produce beneficial results. 

### Now what is a TEST Automation Framework ?

A set of guidelines like coding standards , test-data handling , object repository treatment etc... which when followed during automation scripting produce beneficial outcomes like increase code re-usage , higher portability , reduced script maintenance cost etc. Mind you these are just guidelines and not rules; they are not mandatory and you can still script without following the guidelines. But you will miss out on the advantages of having a Framework.

### Benefits of a Test Automation Framework

Utilizing a framework for automated testing will increase a teamâ€™s test speed and efficiency, improve test accuracy, and will reduce test maintenance costs as well as lower risks. They are essential to an efficient automated testing process for a few key reasons:  

    Improved test efficiency
    Lower maintenance costs
    Minimal manual intervention
    Maximum test coverage
    Reusability of code
