## Test Automation Frameworks - [Stuff](https://www.guru99.com/quick-test-professional-qtp-tutorial-34.html) you must Know!

### What is a Framework ?

Instead of providing a bookish definition of a framework, lets consider an example.

I am sure you have attended a seminar / lecture / conference where the participants was asked to observe the following guidelines -

    Participants should occupy their seat 5 minutes before start of lecture
    Bring along a notebook and pen for note taking.
    Read the abstract so you have an idea of what the presentation will be about.
    Mobile Phones should be set on silent
    Use the exit gates at opposite end to the speaker should you require to leave in middle of the lecture.
    Questions will be taken at the end of the session

Do you think you can conduct a seminar WITHOUT observing these guidelines????
The answer is a big YES! Certainly you can conduct a seminar / lecture / conference / demonstration without above guidelines (in fact some of us will not follow them even though there are laid ... :-)
But if the guidelines are followed it will result in beneficial outcome like reduced audience distraction during lecture and increased participant retention and understanding of the subject matter.
Based on above, a Framework can be defined as a set of guidelines which when followed produce beneficial results. 

### Now what is a TEST Automation Framework ?

A set of guidelines like coding standards , test-data handling , object repository treatment etc... which when followed during automation scripting produce beneficial outcomes like increase code re-usage , higher portability , reduced script maintenance cost etc. Mind you these are just guidelines and not rules; they are not mandatory and you can still script without following the guidelines. But you will miss out on the advantages of having a Framework.

### Benefits of a Test Automation Framework

Utilizing a framework for automated testing will increase a teamâ€™s test speed and efficiency, improve test accuracy, and will reduce test maintenance costs as well as lower risks. They are essential to an efficient automated testing process for a few key reasons:  

    Improved test efficiency
    Lower maintenance costs
    Minimal manual intervention
    Maximum test coverage
    Reusability of code

### What are the various [Automation Frameworks](https://smartbear.com/learn/automated-testing/test-automation-frameworks/) available?

    Linear Automation Framework
    Modular Based Testing Framework
    Library Architecture Testing Framework
    Data-Driven Framework
    Keyword-Driven Framework
    Hybrid Testing Framework

### Serenity (Formally Thucydides)

* Is an open-source tool designed to make writing automated acceptance and regression tests easier.
* Java-based open source test automation framework that integrates with behavior-driven development tools like Cucumber and JBehave
*  To keep your test scenarios at a high level with lower-level implementation details in your reports, Serenity might be the tool for you.
* WebDriver management, managing state between steps, screenshots, running tests in parallel, Jira integration and more
* awesome at is creating unbelievable reports. Out-of-the-box, Serenity creates living documentation that can be used not only to view your Selenium BDD test results, but also as documentation for your application

### Robot Framework

* Python-based open source test automation framework
* Is a mature solution that was created for testers and uses a keyword-driven approach to make tests readable and easy to create
* The keyword approach used by Robot Framework is great for testers who are already familiar with other vendor-based, keyword-driven test tools, making the transition to open source much easier for them. 
*If your team is made up of mostly testers, Robot Framework would be a great option for your open source test automation framework.

### [RedwoodHQ](https://www.joecolantonio.com/2016/05/10/6-open-source-test-automation-frameworks-need-know/)

* Little bit of a different approach from the other tools.
* It creates a website interface that allows multiple testers to work together and run their tests from one web-accessible location.
* Tests can be written in Java/Groovy, Python and C# code to test web applications with Selenium, APIs or databases using their web IDE, which also includes built-in GIT integration.
* s tester friendly and has a lot of built-in features that allow you to create complete test automation and test management solutions for your teams.

### Sahi

* Both an open-source and a pro version.
