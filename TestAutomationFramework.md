## Test Automation Frameworks - [Stuff](https://www.guru99.com/quick-test-professional-qtp-tutorial-34.html) you must Know!

### What is a Framework ?

Instead of providing a bookish definition of a framework, lets consider an example.

I am sure you have attended a seminar / lecture / conference where the participants was asked to observe the following guidelines -

    Participants should occupy their seat 5 minutes before start of lecture
    Bring along a notebook and pen for note taking.
    Read the abstract so you have an idea of what the presentation will be about.
    Mobile Phones should be set on silent
    Use the exit gates at opposite end to the speaker should you require to leave in middle of the lecture.
    Questions will be taken at the end of the session

Do you think you can conduct a seminar WITHOUT observing these guidelines????
The answer is a big YES! Certainly you can conduct a seminar / lecture / conference / demonstration without above guidelines (in fact some of us will not follow them even though there are laid ... :-)
But if the guidelines are followed it will result in beneficial outcome like reduced audience distraction during lecture and increased participant retention and understanding of the subject matter.
Based on above, a Framework can be defined as a set of guidelines which when followed produce beneficial results. 

### Now what is a TEST Automation Framework ?

A set of guidelines like coding standards , test-data handling , object repository treatment etc... which when followed during automation scripting produce beneficial outcomes like increase code re-usage , higher portability , reduced script maintenance cost etc. Mind you these are just guidelines and not rules; they are not mandatory and you can still script without following the guidelines. But you will miss out on the advantages of having a Framework.

### Benefits of a Test Automation Framework

Utilizing a framework for automated testing will increase a team’s test speed and efficiency, improve test accuracy, and will reduce test maintenance costs as well as lower risks. They are essential to an efficient automated testing process for a few key reasons:  

    Improved test efficiency
    Lower maintenance costs
    Minimal manual intervention
    Maximum test coverage
    Reusability of code

### What are the various Automation Frameworks available?

    Linear Automation Framework
    Modular Based Testing Framework
    Library Architecture Testing Framework
    Data-Driven Framework
    Keyword-Driven Framework
    Hybrid Testing Framework

### Linear Automation Framework

With a linear test automation framework, also referred to as a record-and-playback framework, testers don’t need to write code to create functions and the steps are written in a sequential order. In this process, the tester records each step such as navigation, user input, or checkpoints, and then plays the script back automatically to conduct the test.

* Advantages of a linear framework:

    There is no need to write custom code, so expertise in test automation is not necessary.
    This is one of the fastest ways to generate test scripts since they can be easily recorded in a minimal amount of time.
    The test workflow is easier to understand for any party involved in testing since the scripts are laid out in a sequential manner.
    This is also the easiest way to get up and running with automated testing, especially with a new tool. Most automated testing tools today will provide record-and-playback features, so you also won’t need to plan extensively with this framework.

* Disadvantages:

    The scripts developed using this framework aren’t reusable. The data is hardcoded into the test script, meaning the test cases cannot be re-run with multiple sets and will need to be modified if the data is altered.
    Maintenance is considered a hassle because any changes to the application will require a lot of rework. This model is not particularly scalable as the scope of testing expands.
